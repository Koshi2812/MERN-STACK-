  file : git-2.53.0-64-bit.exe

    > git -v 


create github account
  website : https://github.com/
    

    GITHUB
1.	git init   (To initialize the git)
2.	git config --global user.name “Bhavani”  (TO config user name in GITHUB)

In order to add individual files and push it into git we need to do 
1.	git add push.html //certain file for pushing
2.	git commit -m “one file added”

Updated code you need to get use -> git pull 
When one developer gives you collaboration you want to edit that file created by developer here what you need to do exactly for adding content or files in another developer’s code.
1.	Open command prompt and change directory where you want to execute 
2.	git clone url (url of that developer code)
3.	now open that folder in vscode and make the changes what you want to do like adding files or add code in one file 
4.	git add .
5.	git commit -m “write some message here”
6.	git push // pushing the code into the github 
these  will updates changes
Now another developer wants updated code 
The thing the developer needs to do is pull the code 
Command needs to be used 
git pull origin master
